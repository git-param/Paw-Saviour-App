# 🐾 Paw Saviour: Helping Animals in Crisis

**Paw Saviour** is an Android application built using **Flutter and Firebase**, designed to help rescue animals in distress. It empowers citizens to act as first responders by reporting injured or abused animals in real-time. Reports are then routed to relevant NGOs and administrators for quick action.

This project was developed as part of my 3rd-year engineering coursework, with the hope of making a small but meaningful impact in the field of animal welfare.
